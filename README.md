## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! 

I donâ€™t have many coding projects to showcase just yet, but Iâ€™m actively working on it! Stick around, and youâ€™ll learn more about my journey so far and what brought me to the world of coding.

I come from a background in Business Management, with a decade of experience in Procurement & Supply Chain. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Management Processes Technology and am currently working as an E-Procurement Process Expert at Enercon GmbH. My role focuses on process digitalization and automation, where I develop improvement solutions and collaborate with cross-functional teams to enhance processes and optimize systems continuously. 

In addition to my full-time role, I offer end-to-end Power BI services on Upwork, handling everything from data collection to dashboard creation. My advanced analytical skills, combined with expertise in tools like Microsoft Excel (Power Pivot, Macros) and Power BI (DAX, Power Query M), allow me to perform deep data analysis, manage complex datasets, and create comprehensive, insightful dashboards. I also have a track record of delivering complex reports and presentations tailored for C-level executives, leveraging methodologies like data modeling, report automation, and cross-platform integration to transform data into actionable insights.

Recently, I completed the Piscine at 42 Porto, an intense 26-day immersive programming experience that serves as the final stage of 42â€™s selective admission process. For those unfamiliar, 42 is one of the worldâ€™s leading software development schools, renowned for its peer-to-peer, project-based, and gamified learning model. With campuses in over 25 countries and a 100% employability rate, it provides free, top-tier programming education to a global student community.

Currently, Iâ€™m enrolled in the Common Core Program at 42 Porto. This rigorous curriculum delves into a range of software development topics, including algorithms, data structures, system administration, network programming, and web development.

Iâ€™m excited to combine my business expertise with my growing passion for technology. I believe this unique blend of skills allows me to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, delivering impactful solutions that enhance both business operations and technological progress.

Thatâ€™s all for now (a bit plain, I know), but I hope to update this space soon with a more vibrant introduction filled with emojis, programming icons, and all sorts of cool details.  

Thank you for stopping by my profile!

See you around!
